I laughed, I cried, well, I mostly cried, and I vomited profusely for weeks after the viewing of Torgo's mighty and powerful thighs. I can't wait for the sequel, MANOS 2: BACK IN THE HABIT.  That movie will be about Torgo's kooky adventure when the Master dies, and torgo has to pretend he is alive by putting sunglasses over his glazed and bloodshot eyes.  It's a totally original viewing experience!  But other than the beauty that is torgo, this movie blew.\n",

Torgo was a brilliant character as well, from his very sexually appealing passes at the women in this film (how did they resist the charms of Torgo?) to his amazing strength that only requires him to tap Hal with his death stick to knock him out. Other great features of this movie include: the Master's beautiful cape, Hal's widows peak in the mirror (what a camera shot!), and of course Torgo's knees. 100000000000000000000/10!!!

Ever.There's no plot, no dialog that hasn't been on TV since the 80s, I only wish that they'd paid someone genuinely cool to make this, someone skilled enough to take the mickey as hard as possible without letting anyone who would fire them know, but then, they do that best themselves.Plus, there's naked chicks.\n",

This movie was created to appeal to the American Idol fans and I felt that was exactly what the film did. I think people were hating on the film and didn't really give the movie a chance. I think Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini did a great job in this movie. I applaud them for there effort in this movie. I think people should try to understand that the film wasn't created to win an Oscar but to just entertain the American Idol fans. I like American Idol and I enjoyed the film. I encourage others to watch and give this movie a chance.\n",

There was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said \"The F-Word\" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top. And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when Sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. And last of all is when they would randomly put in Bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie. In my opinion, Don't buy this movie, its a waste of money\n",

I also saw the \"Son of the Mask\" and seemed to enjoy watching this as well. Some would say I'm sappy but I did think it cute. I did feel this was setup for a totally different age group than the first. I was surprised at first but feel I was at least open minded not like some of the comments here. \"And no I am not a writer, producer, or anything else attached to this movie.\" I liked the setup for Loki, and how the mask got here was explained very well. Ben Stein played his part so well that it made for a great beginning. They did lose me for a while in the intro of the beloved dog and the baby, this I thought was weak. The party sequence was good up until the western part which dragged. I thought that sometimes the director got lost because there where times when the story skipped a beat. I loved Loki as a character. The dog and baby was great laughs. The father could have been a stronger character than it was. All in all it seemed to me to be setup to explain how the mask got here, and if you didn't go in with a mind set first. I think you would have a great time with this movie. I have friends out side of this country that say the movie is much funnier than the one in the states. That there where parts cut out of this movie for the rating. I LIKED IT. THE STORY WAS CUTE.

The whole room was shaking during some of the blast scenes.  Overall, the movie was very enjoyable.  I  liked the whole concept, especially the fact that this all takes place 1000 years after an alien invasion.  Quite frankly, this is a lot more realistic scenario than Independence Day.  The difference here is that human technology was no match for the aliens.  This is much more realistic since any race which manages to reach Earth with interstellar travel is likely much more technologically advanced than ours.  The key to the human's success is that Johnnie was trained in the alien technology, and then figures out how to use the alien technology against the aliens.  This is much more realistic.  And realize that it was only with the help of the aliens in the first place that the humans learned alien technology.  The chances of the humans being able to figure out the advanced technology without the aliens teaching it to them is almost nil.  There were many other facts which correspond much more closely to real physics than other movies.  So I thought the concept very good, and I would recommend any SF buff to check out this movie, especially if you have a good home theater set up with 5.1 channel Dolby Digital surround.

Humans have this one chance to take back the Earth from alien conquerers, the Psyclos.Battlefield Earth is a way better movie than Wing Commander, Supernova, Virus or Deep Blue Sea. Moving outside the SciFi genre into the broader set of action movies, it's better than Entrapment or The Thomas Crown Affair.READ THE BOOK (it's a 1,000 page edge-of-the-seat rocket ride) and see the movie version of Battlefield Earth.George Lucas said Battlefield Earth is a great movie and he's a man who knows a thing or two about SciFi fight for freedom movies.I'm right here with you George!Take care, be well, have fun,Tom\n",

Forest Whittaker is excellent as Terl's sidekick.  This is a must see for sci-fi fans and anyone that is looking for a fun and action packed movie.\n",

I went and saw it again and the 2nd time I forgot about what I knew about the book and just watched it as if I'd never read it.It changed the whole story for me.  I liked the innovation of the way the scenes changed and it surprised me that 2 hours went so fast.  I loved Barry Pepper.  I had not thought he'd made a good Johnnie.  I also like John t.  he got better in the part as it moved along.  I think this movie will do better than expected\n",

The special effects are spectacular and Travolta is true evil as the Psychlo \"Terl\". This film is better than the last Star Wars and ranks up there with Armageddon. A must see and a must read on the book. I'm looking for a sequel, and seeing this first film more than a couple of times.\n",

      "I enjoyed this movies for several reasons but two stand out more than others: the performances and the theme.I think that Pepper, Travolta and Whitaker were more than excellent.  There were several places where they could have screwed this film up (and I thought that they might) but they not only didn't, they made it work well. Because of the compressed, rushed pace of the film, it would have been easy to let some of the scenes be done in a superficial manner; however, they turned these into scenes that made the characters more understandable. Some character development was done with glances from the actors and that is not an easy task.The theme of the movie is truly noble and might escape some people because it also is not superficial.  It is about a quality that does not exist around us in high quantity and is almost not taught any more.I recommend it and think that parents should encourage their kids to go as well.\n",

      "Battlefield Earth is an acceptably fun action movie. It accomplishes its purpose. There is lots of dumb stuff in it, of course, but that's part of its goofy charm as a B-movie.If you are a sophisticated film aficionado, the kind of person who is really impressed by movies like American Beauty, then you simply must go see this movie. Why on earth would I say something like this? Because, based on some reviews of Battlefield Earth I've read, the movie can in some cases give this type of person a massive, gratifying rush of self-righteous venomous spite, unlike any movie in recent memory. Go figure.I recommend it! I give it a 6 out of 10.\n",

      "Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard. I thought that the movie was well cast and had a great message that intelligence will win over force and that the villain will usually do himself in.  I would highly recommend the book as Mr. Hubbard lays out some great images that were not in the movie.  J.T. I truly enjoyed. Peppers' portrayal of Johnny our hero's quest for freedom, very believable. I thought it was a brave undertaking as the book is vast in its concepts and a must for Science Fiction lovers. I will see it again!\n",

This is creepy, this is dark, this is headache-inducing, this is awful! \"Track of the Moon Beast\" is a movie that is bad when you watch the original version, but good when you watch the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" version. A lot of movies on that great show are like that. I mean, would you rather bore yourself to death with those low budget effects without any assistance from the Bots of MST3K, or would you do the opposite of what I just said? I'm saying, watch this with the Bots on the Satellite of Love! That's a much better way to watch this dung ball of a film!

If this movie is to be believed, strippers typically have dance numbers that rival the half-time shows at the Super Bowl, and yet never manage to take off any clothes!  The (we hope) unintentional hilarity of these numbers makes for entertaining viewing, in the sense that you'll be ROFL the whole time.\n",

Torgo was a brilliant character as well, from his very sexually appealing passes at the women in this film (how did they resist the charms of Torgo?) to his amazing strength that only requires him to tap Hal with his death stick to knock him out. Other great features of this movie include: the Master's beautiful cape, Hal's widows peak in the mirror (what a camera shot!), and of course Torgo's knees. 100000000000000000000/10!!!
